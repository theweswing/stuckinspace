## Description

While developing my coding skills, the idea of building a game intrigued me. I wanted to make something fun, compelling, and complicated. stuck-in-space takes in simple user commands, as the user navigates through a series of rooms, trying to escape the aliens!

## Features

- Command parsing. Five differnent commands + over a dozen 'items' can be typed into the game and understood (e.g. "Inspect window").
- Cascading actions (e.g. picking up an item in an earlier room will effect a later room).
- Multiple ways to exit a level.
- Leaderboard
